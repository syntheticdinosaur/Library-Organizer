LIBRARYORGANIZER

Function:
Collection of MATLAB functions to perform topic modelling on a collection of scientific articles.
Extracted topics, as well as automatically generated keywords, get written to a BibTex file for late rimport into a reference manager of your choice.

Dependencies:
MATLAB 2022a
TEXT ANALYTICS & MACHINE LEARNING AND STATISTICS TOOLBOXES

How to:
Prepare folder with articles/book chapters that you want to analysis (preferably .pdf format) and select it in the GUI.
As a start, you can choose the 20 articles included in "Example Articles".
Default options in GUI dialogues are hinted in blue and should work fine for first tries with the program.
The numbers of topics to be extracted (e.g., research fields/directions) must be based on your intuition, normally, 3-10 can be a good fit depending on the number of files and their diversity in content.
